When a function call its self this is recursion..

when u have to stop use base case..BASE CONDITION  let suppose ---> 2^3,2^2 ,2^1,2^0 and we know that 2^0 is 1 this is over base condition
factorial .......5! =5*4!
and we know 1! is One and zero factorial is also 1.
base case



void print (int n){
base case 
if(n==0)
return;
 
cout<<n;

print (n-1);
}

heap memory ----->dp
stack ------>function
static variable 
code


---------------------------
base case must be reacted before Stack overflow
there are three thing is Recursion...
Mendaotory--->base case ,Recursive call.
option--->inner Work
